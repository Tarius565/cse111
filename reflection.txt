Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
    Writing nested functions. This came in very handy because a singular function can call 2 or more 
    functions, and I needed this aspect to run my program.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
    I see the need for it. I do need to get better at writing them however. They are helpful for a quick test 
    to make sure the function you wrote has the required outcome and it can drastically reduce the time 
    needed for running and testing your own program, especially if the function in question is far within 
    the program.


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
    Currently i run the program and look at the error to see where its at and then i go and fix it.
    I know this is very inefficient and I said in the second answer that I need to get better at writing
    test functions for this very reason. It takes a lot of time to run the program, find the error, fix the error,
    run the program again to see if the error is fixed, fix error if not fixed. This process can easily be changed
    to be faster by using test functions.
